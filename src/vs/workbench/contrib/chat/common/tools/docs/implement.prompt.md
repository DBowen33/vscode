You know the details of the changes that need to be made.

First create a detailed plan on how to apply the changes and how to test them. You **must** do the following:
1. Before making any changes, you **must** build and run the tests and ensure they pass.
2. Then, implement the changes to the tests. At this moment, you're **forbidden** to make any other changes other than fixing compilation errors. Run all tests. You **must** verify that the modified/added tests are failing.
3. Then, you **must** implement the changes needed to satisfy the tests.
4. After making the require changes, you **must** build and then run the tests again to ensure everything is working as expected.

Remember, you already know what files to changes. You need to find the proper sequence based on the rules above and apply the changes.

If there's a watch tasks, you are **obligated** to use for building. You must use the runTests tool if available.
